# AI Sign Language Recognition

### This project is an application built to detect sign language using keypoints extracted using mediapipe.

The project uses an Argentian Sign Language Dataset that can be obtained from the link below:
https://facundoq.github.io/datasets/lsa64/

Data augmentation was an essential part of the project to generalize the data and achieve proper sign detection. 
The project mainly leveraged the part of recurrent neural networks in the detection of continuous sign language in this project. 
The project was complemented with a frontend interface built using React on the frontend and Flask on the backend.
